# Setup Instructions

The HelloQA pipeline works out of the box, but you'll need to download the
Gutenberg index input data separately (it's a big file and doesn't make sense to
keep it in the repository, bad practice and all).

1.  Download the Gutenberg index
[here](https://github.com/downloads/oaqa/helloqa/guten.tar.gz "guten.tar.gz").

2.  Untar it.

3.  Copy the resulting files into the data directory inside your HelloQA
project such that your helloqa/data/guten directory contains bin, conf, data,
lib, etc.
